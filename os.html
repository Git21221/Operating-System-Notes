  <center><h1>Operating System</h1></center>
  <strong>CPU bound process: </strong>These are those processes that require most of the time on CPU.<br>
  <strong>I/O bound process: </strong>These are those processes that require most of the time on I/O devices.<br>
  <strong>N.B: </strong>A good CPU scheduling idea should choose the mixture of both so that both I/O devices and CPU can be utilized correctly.<br>
  <strong>CPU scheduling are of two types: </strong>i) Non-Pre-emptive, ii) Pre-emptive<br>
  <strong>i) Non-Pre-emptive: </strong> We can't forcefully terminate this type of process. This process complete it's execution and leave CPU to perform other operation.<br>
  <strong>ii) Pre-emptive: </strong>If a process enters in the ready state from new or waiting state and high priority process.<br>
  <center><strong>CPU scheduling terminiology</strong></center>
  <strong>i) Burst Time / Execution Time / Running Time: </strong>It's the time process require for running on CPU. <br>
  <strong>ii) Waiting Time: </strong>Time spend by a process in ready state waiting for CPU. <br>
  <strong>iii) Arrival Time: </strong>When a process enters ready state. <br>
  <strong>iv) Exit Time: </strong>When a process completes execution and exit from system. <br>
  <strong>v) Turn Around Time: </strong>It's the time process require for running on CPU. T.A.T == E.T - A.T == B.T + W.T<br>
  <strong>vi) Response Time: </strong>It's the time between a process enters ready queue and get scheduled on the CPU for the first time. <br>
  <center><strong>CPU scheduling algorithm criteria</strong></center>
  <strong>i) Average waiting time: </strong> Average waiting time should be as low as possible <br>
  <strong>ii) Average response time: </strong> Average response time should be as low as possible<br>
  <strong>iii) CPU utilization: </strong>CPU utilization should be a high all time. <br>
  <strong>iv) Throughput: </strong> Number of process execution per unit time. <br>
  <center><strong>FCFS (First Come First Serve)</strong></center>
  i) Simplest scheduling algorithm, it assigns CPU to the process which arrives first. <br>
  ii) Easy to understand and can easily be implemented using Queue data structure. <br>
  iii) Always non-pre-emptive in nature. <br>

  <center><strong>Convoy Effect</strong></center>
  Smaller process have to wait for long time for bigger process to release CPU. <br>
  <strong>Advantage: </strong> Simple, easy to use, easy to understand, easy to implement, must be used for background process where execution is not urgent. <br>
  <strong>Disadvantage: </strong> Suffer from convoy effect, normally higher average waiting time, no consideration on priority or burst time, should not be used for interactive system. <br>
  <center><strong>Shortest Job First (Non-Pre-emptive) / Shortest Remaining Time First (Pre-emptive)</strong></center>
  i) Process, who have small burst time will assigned first. <br>
  ii) In case of tie, FCFS is used. <br>
  iii) It uses both pre-emptive and non-pre-emptive approach. <br>
