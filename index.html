    <center><h1>Operating System</h1></center>
    <strong>CPU bound process: </strong>These are those processes that require
    most of the time on CPU.<br />
    <strong>I/O bound process: </strong>These are those processes that require
    most of the time on I/O devices.<br />
    <strong>N.B: </strong>A good CPU scheduling idea should choose the mixture
    of both so that both I/O devices and CPU can be utilized correctly.<br />
    <strong>CPU scheduling are of two types: </strong>i) Non-Pre-emptive, ii)
    Pre-emptive<br />
    <strong>i) Non-Pre-emptive: </strong> We can't forcefully terminate this
    type of process. This process complete it's execution and leave CPU to
    perform other operation.<br />
    <strong>ii) Pre-emptive: </strong>If a process enters in the ready state
    from new or waiting state and high priority process.<br />
    <center><strong>CPU scheduling terminiology</strong></center>
    <strong>i) Burst Time / Execution Time / Running Time: </strong>It's the
    time process require for running on CPU. <br />
    <strong>ii) Waiting Time: </strong>Time spend by a process in ready state
    waiting for CPU. <br />
    <strong>iii) Arrival Time: </strong>When a process enters ready state.
    <br />
    <strong>iv) Exit Time: </strong>When a process completes execution and exit
    from system. <br />
    <strong>v) Turn Around Time: </strong>It's the time process require for
    running on CPU. T.A.T == E.T - A.T == B.T + W.T<br />
    <strong>vi) Response Time: </strong>It's the time between a process enters
    ready queue and get scheduled on the CPU for the first time. <br />
    <center><strong>CPU scheduling algorithm criteria</strong></center>
    <strong>i) Average waiting time: </strong> Average waiting time should be as
    low as possible <br />
    <strong>ii) Average response time: </strong> Average response time should be
    as low as possible<br />
    <strong>iii) CPU utilization: </strong>CPU utilization should be a high all
    time. <br />
    <strong>iv) Throughput: </strong> Number of process execution per unit time.
    <br />
    <center><strong>FCFS (First Come First Serve)</strong></center>
    i) Simplest scheduling algorithm, it assigns CPU to the process which
    arrives first. <br />
    ii) Easy to understand and can easily be implemented using Queue data
    structure. <br />
    iii) Always non-pre-emptive in nature. <br />

    <center><strong>Convoy Effect</strong></center>
    Smaller process have to wait for long time for bigger process to release
    CPU. <br />
    <strong>Advantage: </strong> Simple, easy to use, easy to understand, easy
    to implement, must be used for background process where execution is not
    urgent. <br />
    <strong>Disadvantage: </strong> Suffer from convoy effect, normally higher
    average waiting time, no consideration on priority or burst time, should not
    be used for interactive system. <br />

    i) Process, who have small burst time will assigned first. <br />

    <strong>Advantages: </strong> <br />
    i) SRTF generates minimal average waiting time. <br />
    ii) Provide a standard for other algo in terms of average waiting time.
    <br />
    iii) Better average response time compare to FCFS. <br />
    <strong>Disadvantages: </strong> <br />
    i) Algo can't be implemented as there is no way to know the burst time of a
    process. <br />
    ii) Process with longer CPU burst time requirement will go into starvation.
    <br />
    iii) No idea of priority, process with large burst time have poor response
    time. <br />
    <center><strong>Priority Algorithm (Non-Pre-emptive)</strong></center>
    i) Here a priority is associated with each process. <br />
    ii) At any instance of time out of all available process, CPU s allocated to
    the process which has the highest priority (number maybe higher or lower)
    <br />
    iii) Tie is broken using FCFS order. <br />
    iv) No importace to A.T or B.T. <br />
    v) Supports both non-pre-emptive and pre-emptive version <br />

    i) Here process with the smaller priority may starve for the CPU. <br />
    ii) No idea of response time or waiting time. <br />

    parity of process that wait in the system for long time. <br />
    <center><strong>Round-Robin</strong></center>
    <br />
    i) Designed for time sharing system. <br />
    ii) It divides time of the CPUamong the processes in ready state, and
    circularly repeat the same process. <br />
    iii) Here we fix a time quantum for a process to execute a process. After
    time quantum limit exceed the next process will come to queuefor executing.
    <br />
    iv) RR is pre-emptive in nature. <br />

    <strong>Advantages: </strong> <br />
    i) Perform best in terms of response time. <br />
    ii) Works well in case of time sharing, client server architecture and
    intermediate system. <br />
    iii) Kind of SJF implementation. <br />
    <strong>Disadvantages: </strong> <br />
    i) Bigger process may starve. <br />
    ii) performance depends ehavily on time quantum. <br />
    iii) No idea of priority. <br />
    <center><strong>Process Synchronization</strong></center>
    <strong>Race Condition: - </strong>multiple processes are involved in the
    system and these process access some shared resources now if they access in
    a mix fashion then system gives different result sometime. <br />
    <strong>Critical Section Problem</strong> <br />
    i) Mutual Exclusion - Critical Sectin will only be accessed by single
    process at a time.<br />
    ii) Progress - Those process should enter C.S who wants to.<br />
    iii) Bounded Wait (optional) - After a specific space of time the process
    should exit CS to overcome starving. <br />
    <strong>Semaphore</strong> <br />
    A semaphore is an integer variable int s that apart from initialization is
    accessed through two atomic standards.
    <pre>
    i) wait(s) => wait(s){
      while(s <= 0);
      s--;
    }
    ii) signal(s) => signal(s){
      s++;
    }
  </pre
    >
    <pre>
<strong>Code</strong>
  do{
    wait(s);
    //critical Section
    signal(s)
    //remainder section
  }
  while(true);
</pre>
    <strong>Uses of Semaphore: </strong> <br />
    i) Critical Section Problem solving. <br />
    ii) To decide order of execution. <br />
    iii) For managing resources. <br />
    <strong>What is Deadlock?</strong>
    If all the resources are circularly depending on each other then the state
    is called deadlock.
    <strong>Four condition of deadlock: </strong>
    i) Mutual Exclusion ii) Hold and Wait iii) non-pre-emtion process iv)
    Circular wait
    <strong>Deadlock handling method: </strong>
    i) Prevention ii) Avoidance iii) detection and recovery iv) Ignorance /
